This solution is based on Navier Stokes Equations and that paper by Jos Stam

-Controls- 

    Mouse:
        Left Click : Apply Force
        Right Click : add/remove density

    Keys:
        R : changes active color to red 
        G : changes active color to green
        B : changes active color to blue

        CTRL : swaps between adding or removing dye
        
        C : clears screen
        \ : displays current settings

        - : reduces diffusion
        = : increases diffusion
        [ : reduces viscocity
        ] : increases viscocity
        ; : reduces force
        ' : increases force
        . : reduces amount of dye added or removed
        / : increases amount of dye added or removed

        1 : adds an emitter at the mouse position with the current dye settings.
